# growth-jarvis

growth-jarvis (placeholder name) is a tool that can read your jira tickets and provide feedback on your performance on the assumption that you have met the demands of the ticket. It was created because I routinely forgot to fill out my Bi Weekly CTCs and had nothing written down for my performance throughout the year that I could use in my mid year performance review. I obviously didn't want to have to go through every single ticket I did and think about how it fit into each of the performance categories, so this automated system aims to solve that problem.

## future improvements

from creating the system to fill out my mid year review I think this could be a useful tool for providing feedback on professional development my leveraging documentation around work like tickets etc.
